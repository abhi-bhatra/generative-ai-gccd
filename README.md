# Restaurant Menu Image Generation with Imagen and Gemini on Vertex AI

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to generate high-quality visual assets for a restaurant menu using Google Cloud's Vertex AI, specifically leveraging the Imagen and Gemini Pro models. The notebook guides you through the process of creating detailed images from simple text descriptions, providing an efficient way to build and edit AI-powered imagery.

## Objectives
The primary goal of this notebook is to help you create visually appealing assets for a restaurant menu. You will achieve this by:

1. **Generating an Image Prompt with Gemini Pro**: Learn how to use the Gemini Pro model to generate creative and contextually appropriate image prompts based on text descriptions.
2. **Creating High-Quality Images with Imagen**: Utilize the Imagen model to produce detailed and high-resolution images from the generated prompts.
3. **Implementing a Visual Asset Pipeline**: Set up a short pipeline to streamline the creation of visual assets, ensuring consistency and quality across the generated images.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. **Set Up Google Cloud Project**: Ensure you have a Google Cloud project set up with billing enabled. You need access to Vertex AI and permissions to use Imagen and Gemini Pro.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python libraries and dependencies.
4. **Run the Notebook**: Open the Jupyter notebook `Restaurant_Menu_Image_Generation.ipynb` and follow the instructions provided. Make sure to authenticate with Google Cloud and set up your Vertex AI environment.
5. **Generate Images**: Use the notebook to create prompts and generate images. Customize the prompts based on your specific menu items and aesthetic preferences.
